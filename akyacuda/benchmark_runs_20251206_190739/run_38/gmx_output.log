Data prefix:  /arf/home/ecevik/gromacs
Working dir:  /arf/scratch/ecevik/workspace/benchmark_runs_barbuncuda/benchmark_runs_20251206_190739/run_38
Command line:
  gmx mdrun -s md_0_250ns_nohmr.tpr -ntmpi 3 -ntomp 7 -nb gpu -pme gpu -bonded gpu -npme 1 -gpu_id 0 -nsteps 50000 -noconfout -dlb yes -pin on

Reading file md_0_250ns_nohmr.tpr, VERSION 2024.2 (single precision)
Note: file tpx version 133, software tpx version 137
Overriding nsteps with value passed on the command line: 50000 steps, 100 ps
Changing nstlist from 10 to 100, rlist from 1 to 1.17


Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

On host akya9 1 GPU selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 3 GPU tasks in the 3 ranks on this node:
  PP:0,PP:0,PME:0
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged and most bonded interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the CPU
PME tasks will do all aspects on the GPU
GPU direct communication will be used between MPI ranks.
Using 3 MPI threads
Using 7 OpenMP threads per tMPI thread

starting mdrun 'GROup of MAchos and Cynical Suckers in water'
50000 steps,    100.0 ps.


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was permanently on during the run per user request.
 Average load imbalance: 0.2%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 23%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 0.1%.
 Steps where the load balancing was limited by -rdd, -rcon and/or -dds: X 0 %
 Average PME mesh/force load: 1.704
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 1.3 %


NOTE: 15 % of the run time was spent in domain decomposition,
      2 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)

GROMACS reminds you: "If at first you don't succeed, try two more times so that your failure is statistically significant." (Dallas Warren)
