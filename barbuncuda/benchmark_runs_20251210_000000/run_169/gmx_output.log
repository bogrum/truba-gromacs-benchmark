Executable:   /arf/home/ecevik/gromacs/bin/gmx
Data prefix:  /arf/home/ecevik/gromacs
Working dir:  /arf/scratch/ecevik/workspace/benchmark_runs_barbuncuda/barbuncuda/benchmark_runs_barbuncuda/run_169
Command line:
  gmx mdrun -s md_0_250ns_nohmr.tpr -ntmpi 33 -ntomp 1 -nb gpu -pme gpu -bonded cpu -npme 1 -gpu_id 0 -nsteps 50000 -noconfout -dlb yes

Reading file md_0_250ns_nohmr.tpr, VERSION 2024.2 (single precision)
Note: file tpx version 133, software tpx version 137
Overriding nsteps with value passed on the command line: 50000 steps, 100 ps
Changing nstlist from 10 to 100, rlist from 1 to 1.17


Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

On host barbun137 1 GPU selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 33 GPU tasks in the 33 ranks on this node:
  PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PME:0
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the CPU
PME tasks will do all aspects on the GPU
GPU direct communication will be used between MPI ranks.
Using 33 MPI threads
Using 1 OpenMP thread per tMPI thread


NOTE: The number of threads is not equal to the number of (logical) cpus
      and the -pin option is set to auto: will not pin threads to cpus.
      This can lead to significant performance degradation.
      Consider using -pin on (and -pinoffset in case you run multiple jobs).

Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was permanently on during the run per user request.
 Average load imbalance: 2.5%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 67%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 1.7%.
 Steps where the load balancing was limited by -rdd, -rcon and/or -dds: X 0 % Y 0 % Z 0 %
 Average PME mesh/force load: 2.737
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 46.3 %

NOTE: 46.3 % performance was lost because the PME ranks
      had more work to do than the PP ranks.
      You might want to increase the number of PME ranks
      or increase the cut-off and the grid spacing.
